                    <p class="sub-header fs-28">Roadmap for 2021</p>
                    <p class="fw-7 fs-20 pt-2">Background:</p>
                    <p><b>Bitcoin's phenomenal rise</b> backed by institutional adoption has confirmed the appetite for <b>digital assets by mainstream markets and investors.</b> Today, Bitcoin is positioned as a <b>scarce digital asset with very high liquidity,</b> and this liquidity, mining, and adoption are managed in a fairly decentralized manner by its community members.</p>
                    <p><b>XDC is positioned to connect real-world finance origination to DeFi markets</b> and XinFin's focus is for <b>XDC to be a de-facto standard for recording payment obligations</b> for institutions which include <b>buyers, suppliers, governments, and banks.</b> Payment obligations can also be recorded for employer to employee transactions which can potentially create opportunities for payday loans, mortgage origination, and auto loans on the XDC Network.</p>
                    <p><b>Governments raise billions through bonds</b> which are essentially payment obligations. Currently, this space is empty and there is no platform that focuses on this particular feature. Enabling this creates a massive opportunity to run <b>DeFi backed by real-world assets on top of the XDC network.</b>
                    <p><b>Central banks pour liquidity into financial markets</b> so that liquidity can reach <b>MSMEs at the grassroots level.</b> XDC is positioned to absorb such liquidity and distribute it via originators that connect to TradeFinex on the <b>XDC Network.</b></p>
                    <p>We are expecting a third-party developer to deliver payment obligations on the XDC network which will be used by the <b>initial 2 integrations, Validus and Funding Societies.<b> There are ongoing discussions with regulated financial institutions (<b><a href="disclosures-vs-non-disclosures" style="text-decoration: underline !important;">Know More</a></b>) to bring their payment obligations for instruments such as <b>letters of credits, invoices, and receivables</b> onto the XDC Network.</p>
                    <p>While the Core Team is focused on the adoption of XDC and the network, it's clear that in order for us to operate as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, the participation of the XDC community is needed to achieve the following objectives:</p>
                    <ul class="lower-alpha">
                        <li>XDC Integrations across hardware and software wallets, and the addition of more digital asset custodians and crypto exchanges.</li>
                        <li>Provide XDC liquidity to support trade finance liquidity.</li>
                        <li>Increase XDC adoption through marketing efforts that build awareness about the XDC Network's protocol and benefits.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="fs-20 pt-2">We are happy to share this roadmap with our core community members so that we can collectively grow the XDC Network into a market leader in 2021.</p>
