                <h3 class="title-xs fs-5 text-left">Open Source and Community-Driven</h3>
                <p class="subtitle subtitle-s fs-6 mb-4">The XDC Network is an open-source, community-driven project that is still in the innovation stage. As such, all numbers, details, and projections provided are indicative and subject to change. There is no guarantee of future performance, outcomes, or any returns on contributions made to the network.</p>
                
                <h3 class="title-xs fs-5 text-left">Participation at Your Own Risk</h3>
                <p class="subtitle subtitle-s fs-6 mb-4">Participation in the XDC Network should be viewed as an involvement in an innovative, experimental project. Participants should be aware that any value added may carry a risk of total loss (100%). It is crucial to participate with caution and a clear understanding of the potential risks, without expecting any guaranteed return.</p>
                
                <h3 class="title-xs fs-5 text-left">XDC as Underlying Fuel</h3>
                <p class="subtitle subtitle-s fs-6 mb-4">XDC serves as the underlying fuel to power decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contract execution on the network. Its utility and value are subject to the network's performance and adoption.</p>
                
                <h3 class="title-xs fs-5 text-left">Masternode Rewards and Experiments</h3>
                <p class="subtitle subtitle-s fs-6 mb-4">Operating a masternode, Validators node or backup node or Standby Node within the network is experimental and comes with no guarantee of future rewards or returns. It should be treated as a contribution to the network's innovation and development.</p>
                
                <h3 class="title-xs fs-5 text-left">No Regulatory Oversight</h3>
                <p class="subtitle subtitle-s fs-6 mb-4">The XDC Network is not registered with any regulatory agency and operates more like a lab project. It does not offer regulated financial instruments, and the XDC coin is not subject to the same regulatory requirements as exchange-traded or mutual funds.

                <h3 class="title-xs fs-5 text-left">No Guarantees or Warranties</h3>
                <p class="subtitle subtitle-s fs-6 mb-4">The XDC Foundation provides the Website (XinFin.org or XDC.Org or other related tools website or associate website) on an "as is" basis and does not offer any warranties regarding the content, data, or services provided.
