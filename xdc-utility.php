                <p>The XDC token is the underlying utility token that powers XinFin's Hybrid Blockchain. The XDC token acts as a settlement mechanism for DApps built on the XinFin Hybrid Blockchain.<!-- XinFin has also launched an Ethereum token called XDCE that can be traded with XDC utility token at a 1:1 ratio. This gives the token holder flexibility to hold tokens in either form for utility. The ERC-20 token can be swapped for the XDC token at a ratio of 1:1. This swap can be facilitated on the AlphaEx exchange. AlphaEx is compatible with all decentralised exchanges and has a presence in liquidity markets and supports XDC liquidity.</p>-->
                <p>To date, use cases built around XinFin's XDC utility token are: MyContract, TradeFinex, Kramaa, Land Registry, iFactor, Blockdegree and TurantPay.</p>

            <p>BLOCKFUND is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows nonprofits to pre-program the distribution of donations received on the blockchain that can provide donors with premium benefits by offering them "proof of donation" NFTs.</p>
            <p>By using blockchain technology, the dApp can ensure the transparency and immutability of the donation process, which can build trust and credibility with donors. When a donor makes a contribution on the blockchain, the dApp will automatically distribute the funds according to the conditions specified in the smart contract. This NFT serves as a digital certificate that verifies the donation and provides evidence of the donor's support for the nonprofit.</p>

            <p>Asset tokenization is the process of transforming the value of a physical asset into digital asset-backed tokens. The digital tokens are created on a distributed ledger or blockchain platform. Such asset-backed tokens can be conveniently created on an asset tokenization platform, as well as can be traded in the market. The value of the tokens can't be erased, changed, or altered by any single authority due to the decentralized nature of blockchain infrastructure that helps establish trust.</p>
