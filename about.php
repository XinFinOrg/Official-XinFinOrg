        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>We as an organization are on a mission to improve the overall deficit in the global infrastructure with the help
          of Blockchain technology. We as a company have revolutionized the concept of peer-to-peer transaction by using
          community driven digital assets in an open source blockchain platform.
          <br/>
          <br/> The core idea behind our initiative is to make the transactions more secure and transparent among the parties
          involved in a cross-border trade. XinFin, as an organization; believes in establishing an environment that will
          help businesses to thrive without having to worry about the hassles of the international fund transfer.</p>

        <p>XINFIN Foundation is a non-profit organization which liaises with different international governments in order to
          reduce the existing gap in global infrastructure. According to XinFin, the lack of government sponsored financing
          hinders the possibility of many infrastructure projects around the globe.
          <br/>
          <br/> However, by means of creating a secured blockchain transaction platform, XinFin aims to bridge that gap wherein
          the investors can bid for different infrastructure projects and finance them in a smoother way, thereby avoiding
          all the issues and paperwork that arises during the process of allocating finance to an infrastructure project
          happening in a different country. The idea is to leverage the facilities of blockchain platform to connect the
          investors and the developers in a secure environment thereby allowing them to transact finances against certain
          secured digital assets.</p>
