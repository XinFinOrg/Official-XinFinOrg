        <p>XinFin Foundation is a non-profit organization which liaises with different international governments in order to
          reduce the existing gap in global infrastructure. According to XinFin, the lack of government sponsored financing
          hinders the possibility of many infrastructure projects around the globe.
          <br/>
          <br/> However, by means of creating a secured blockchain transaction platform, XinFin aims to bridge that gap wherein
          the investors can bid for different infrastructure projects and finance them in a smoother way, thereby avoiding
          all the issues and paperwork that arises during the process of allocating finance to an infrastructure project
          happening in a different country. The idea is to leverage the facilities of blockchain platform to connect the
          investors and the developers in a secure environment thereby allowing them to transact finances against certain
          secured digital assets.</p>
